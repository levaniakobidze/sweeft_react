# Sweeft React.js Acceleration Program Project

This project, developed by Levan Iakobidze as part of the Sweeft React.js Acceleration Program, aims to provide users with a seamless experience for accessing essential information about different countries.

## Features

### 1. Choose Country

üåç Users are presented with a comprehensive list of all possible countries, sourced from the Countries API. They can effortlessly select their desired country from this list.

### 2. Automatic Location Detection

üìç The application intelligently determines the user's location upon the initial page load, utilizing latitude and longitude data. To achieve this, the application will request location permissions from the user.

### 3. Currency Exchange

üí± Upon selecting a country, users have access to two main pages:

a. **Currency Exchange**

- Users can specify the destination country (where they intend to exchange currency).
- They can input the amount of money they wish to convert, and the application will instantly provide the equivalent value in the chosen currency.

b. **Airport Information**

- Users can explore a list of airports within the selected country.
- A search functionality allows users to quickly find specific airports in the country.
